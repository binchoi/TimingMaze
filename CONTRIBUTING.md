Changes are to be made through pull requests from contributor's fork. All other changes will be rejected.
Ensure that you sync your fork before creating a pull request.
No changes must be made to the simulator files, changes must only go to the player directory.
Add your group name to the pull request so we can understand the contributor. 
A general comment on the PR like "Group 3 deliverable 18 September" would be perfect.
